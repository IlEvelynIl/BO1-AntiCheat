# BO1-AntiCheat
A tool for competitive Black Ops 1 Zombies specifically designed to catch people cheating.

## Why?
Modern problems require modern solutions. While the current solution may be a good way to catch cheaters one way, there are others that are not accounted for. Based on a few players' opinions in the community, something like this seems to be the only way to solve all of the current cheating issues, as anti cheat programs can evolve just like the cheating methods themselves.

This tool can also be updated to verify setup patches if the community votes on allowing such in the future.

## Using it in your games
- If you decide to use this for your games, open it along side Black Ops 1 and it will automatically connect to the game. Make sure to follow the guidelines
- For coop games, only the host will need to use the tool.
- You may notice that there is not a minimize button, this is on purpose to prevent confusion with OBS not picking it up. Just let the program sit behind the game or another monitor.

## Guidelines
Since this tool is open source, below are some easy to follow guidelines that you must follow, the community has to verify that you are actually using it.
- You must show the BO1-AntiCheat.exe file properties.
- You must show yourself opening the tool.
- Display the tool on your stream/recording.

## Why did my antivirus block the download?
This is likely due to Windows Defender's sensitivity to programs without a signature. Rest assured, there's nothing harmful in the tool, hence why its open source. If you want to verify that it's safe, you can build it from the source code.
